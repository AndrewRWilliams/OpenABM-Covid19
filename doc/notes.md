Notes on modelling the COVID-19 outbreak
========================================


Data
----

* Contacts per day.  Mossong et al., 2008 ([here](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050074) has data on contacts per day across age, location (work/home), day of the week.  

* Mobile phone usage with age.  Office of National Statistics has data on this, [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/mobilephonedata2016to2017).  In a very rough form.  

* UK government's Department for Transport has a document on *Commuting trends in England 1988 - 2015*.  This has average commuting distance but not a distribution of commute times.  [Here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/commuting-trends-in-england-1988-to-2015).  Milne et al. (2008) use commute times to distribute adults to households/work hubs.
